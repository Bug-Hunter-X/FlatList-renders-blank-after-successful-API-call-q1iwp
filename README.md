## React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component remains blank after successfully fetching data from an API.  The API call completes without errors, but the list fails to render.

The `DataFetch.js` file contains the buggy code.  The solution is provided in `DataFetchSolution.js`.

This issue highlights the importance of careful error handling and data validation when working with asynchronous operations and UI updates in React Native.
